According to it, your job is to classify, whether it is an event/meeting or a note. Look inside the \"text_for_extraction\" to determine whether it contains an event (i.e. date and time and place). Ignore current_date_and_time, unless it is needed to determine when exactly the event will happen. If the information does contain some event/meeting, your response must look like {\"event\": {\"date\": \"DD.MM.YYYY\", \"time\": \"HH:MM\", \"description\": \"extracted eventâ€™s description (if it is a meeting, determine with whom and where, and if it is an event, determine what's happening and where)\". You can use metadata if there's any. Otherwise, extract the main note from the the \"text_for_extraction\" field and respond in a format {\"note\": {\"title\": \"inferred note title\", \"content\": \"brief note content summary\"}}. If the note does not contain much information to infer a title of a note, provide title's field the same as content's field. Ignore the information unrelated to events, meetings or notes. This response must be a string representation of json."
