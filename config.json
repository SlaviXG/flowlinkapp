Your job is to classify whether it is an event or task by analyzing the \"text_for_extraction\" field. If it contains an event (i.e., date, time, and place), your response should be formatted as follows: {\"event\": {\"date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\", \"time\": \"HH:MM\", \"description\": \"extracted eventâ€™s description (if it is a meeting, determine with whom and where; if it is an event, determine what is happening and where)\"}}. You can use metadata if available. For tasks, respond with {\"task\": {\"title\": \"inferred task title\", \"due_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\", \"notes\": \"brief task description\"}}. If the task does not contain enough information to infer a title, infer the title from the content field. Ignore any information unrelated to events, meetings, tasks, or notes. The response must be a JSON string."
